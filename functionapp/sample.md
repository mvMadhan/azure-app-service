# Building an Event-Driven Azure Function for Blob Storage Triggers

## Overview

In this scenario, you will create an Azure Function App using Visual Studio Code (VS Code) and integrate it with an Azure Storage Account. The Storage Account will have a container named "images" where uploaded files will be stored. The Azure Function will be configured to trigger automatically whenever a new image is uploaded to the container. Upon triggering, the function will display the name and size of the uploaded image, demonstrating how serverless functions can process events in real-time.

## Objective

This exercise is designed to provide hands-on experience in setting up an event-driven Azure Function and integrating it with Azure Storage. By completing this task, you will learn to:

  - Create an Azure Function App: Develop a serverless function using VS Code and deploy it to Azure.
  - Integrate with Azure Storage: Connect the function to a Storage Account container to monitor for new uploads.
  - Trigger and Process Events: Configure the function to automatically trigger when an image is uploaded and extract metadata (name and size).
  - Validate the Solution: Verify that the function executes correctly by uploading an image and checking the logs for the expected output.

## Prerequisites

  - An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create/Login Azure account](https://portal.azure.com/#home)
  - Visual Studio Code. [Download visual studios code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
